    "| Protocol | Implementing Collections |\n",
    "|---|---|\n",
    "| Container | str, list, range, tuple, set, bytes, dict |\n",
    "| Sized | str, list, range, tuple, set, bytes, dict |\n",
    "| Iterable | str, list, range, tuple, set, bytes, dict |\n",

    "\n",
    "## Container\n",
    "The `Container` protocol allow us to determine if a given value is part of the collection. This is done by using the `in` and `not in` operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "It requires the collection to implement the `__contains__(item)` method, however, **it falls back to the `Iterable` protocol if implemented**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sized\n",
    "The `Sized` protocol allow us to determine the length of the collection. This is done by passing the collection to the `len()` build-in function.\n",
    "\n",
    "It requires the collection to implement the `__len__()` method. **It must not consume or modify the collection**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Iterable\n",
    "The `Iterable` protocol allow us to iterate over the collection. This is done by using the `iter(iterable)` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "It requires the collection to implement the `__iter__()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sequence\n",
    "The `Sequence` protocol allow us to do the following:\n",
    "* Retrieve an item from the sequence by using the square brakets `item = seq[index]`\n",
    "* Retrieve a slice of items form the sequence by using the square brakets `items = seq[start:stop]`\n",
    "* Produce a reversed sequence by calling the build-in function reversed `r = reversed(seq)`\n",
    "* Find the position of a given item in the sequence `position = seq.index(item)`\n",
    "* Count the amount of items that are the same as the one provided `num = seq.count(item)`\n",
    "* Concatenate sequences by using the `+` operator `new_seq = seq1 + seq2`\n",
    "* Repete sequences by using the `*` operator `new_seq = seq1 * 100`\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to provide all this functionality stated above the collection first needs to implement the `Container`, the `Sized` and the `Iterable` protocols. In addition to that, the collection needs to implement the following extra methods:\n",
    "* `__getitem__(item)` allows the collection to retrieve items and slices by using square brakets.\n",
    "* `__reversed__()` allows the collection to produce a reversed sequence. **Uses `__getitem__()` and `__len__()` as fallback**.\n",
    "* **No extra methods are required to find the index of an item or to count items**. However, the methods available in the base class might not be the most performant `O(n)`. **If there is a faster way to obtain this information the methods to be implemented are `index` and `count` respectively**.\n",
    "* `__add__()` allows the collection to concatenate sequences. **It must produce a new sequence**.\n",
    "* `__mul__()` and `__rmul__()` allows the collection to repete sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Set\n",
    "The `Set` protocol allow us to do the following set operations:\n",
    "\n",

    "| special method | infix operator | set method | meaning |\n",
    "|---|---|---|---|\n",
    "| `__len__()` | <= | issubset() | subset |\n",
    "| `__lt__()` | < | | proper subset |\n",
    "| `__eq__()` | == | | equal |\n",
    "| `__ne__()` | != | | not equal |\n",
    "| `__gt__()` | > | | proper superset |\n",
    "| `__ge__()` | >= | issuperset() | superset |\n",

    "| `__and__()` | & | intersection() |\n",
    "| `__or__()` | \\| | union() |\n",
